# TRChallengeReloadCore3_1
Trying to evolve my attempt at TrainRoadChallengeV2 into a framework

This is how I'm trying to evolve my attempt at https://github.com/trainerroad/BackendRefactorChallengeV2 into a more generic framework.
I restarted from scratch the one I submitted (which was quite different) this time on top of netcore3.1 LTS and MongoDb.

MongoDb is freely hosted by Atlas at https://www.mongodb.com/en/company
